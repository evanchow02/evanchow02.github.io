    description: "**Air Fryer Salmon and Roasted Broccoli**  \nI finally gave the craze of air fried salmon a try and it did not disappoint. The salmon was tender on the inside and flakey around the edges, which paired perfectly with the crunchy broccoli. Also, the whole meal only took 20 minutes to cook!  \n**Rating: 8.5/10**"

    description: "**Chicken Pesto Pasta**  \nI was craving pasta and needed to use up a jar of week-old pesto. The chicken turned out a little dryer than I like, but the overall flavor was solid. I decided to add spinach and roasted tomatoes with garlic for some veggies, which made the dish pop!  \n**Rating: 7/10**"

    description: "**Chicken Pita Pizza**  \nTime to be creative! I hadn't had pizza in a while but saw the opportunity to make it after surveying all the ingredients in my dorm room. I used pita bread as the crust and feta for the cheese. It didn't taste like a traditional pizza, but it sure looked like one.  \n**Rating: 7.5/10**"

    description: "**Turkey Pesto Sandwich**  \nI discovered this glorious sandwich during my Summer 2022 internship. Needing something quick and easy to make for my lunch break, I decided to layer pesto, sliced turkey breast, and creamy gouda cheese onto toasted sour dough bread. This sandwich definitely made my lunch breaks.  \n**Rating: 8.5/10**"

    description: "**Chicken Fajita Tacos**  \nJust some classic chicken fajitas with corn tortillas. The chicken could have used more seasoning and was a little dry, but the guacamole on top helped. I ended up buying way too many corn tortillas than I needed for this dish!  \n**Rating: 6/10**"

    description: "**Chicken Gyros**  \nThe chicken was marinated in greek yogurt, which tenderized the meat and added a tangy flavor. With lots of ingredients and seasonings, the dish had depth, but the star of the show was the feta crumbles on top.  \n**Rating: 7/10**"

    description: "**Panang Curry**  \nAfter searching for easy Instant Pot dishes, I stumbled across this [panang curry](https://www.paintthekitchenred.com/thai-instant-pot-panang-curry-with-chicken/). Having never made panang curry I was excited to try, and this simple recipe turned out great. I decided to add carrots to the recipe and modified a couple of the ingredients, but still produced a sweet, salty, Thai spicy dish. The curry was rich in flavor, and I will definitely be making it again!  \n**Rating: 9/10**"

    description: "**Shrimp Fried Rice**  \nMom's famous shrimp fried rice! For as long as I can remember, the Panda Express style wok has been a staple kitchen appliance in our household. Growing up, I was fortunate enough to enjoy all types of Chinese stir fry dishes with fried rice always being a family and friend favorite. The shrimp fried rice had a nice char and smokey flavor from the high heat of the wok and the onions and carrots added a balanced sweetness. Even though a seasoned wok adds an unique depth of flavor to the dish, the secret ingredient to my mom's fried rice is white pepper. When I cook fried rice it is often rare that I have access to a wok, but by simply adding white pepper my fried rice is elevated and I am reminded of home.  \n**Rating: 9.5/10**"
