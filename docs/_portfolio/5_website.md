By combining the advice I recieved to start an engineering portfolio and my desire to learn web development, I decided to create this personal website. The main tools used to create my website are [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a package written in Ruby that allows for static site generation, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which hosts my website. Having never had prior experience with web development, Jekyll made it easy for me to start building my website as it supports website templates online. However, as I started to build my website I quickly found myself wanting to make modifications to the [template](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme/) I found, but lacked the knowledge of how to do so. I found myself scouring the web to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Liquid and eventually, I was able to create the "Additional Interests" section as well as change a majority of the template layouts and functionality.

As I continue to build my personal website, I am learning the importance of perseverance, especially when it comes to learning a new skill. From the start of learning about web development, I quickly realized the expansiveness and depth of the subject. Modifying certain HTML and CSS files for my website often took me days to fully figure out, but the long hours only made seeing the desired results even more rewarding. I am excited to continue building my website and exploring web development and look forward to sharing what I have and will learn!
